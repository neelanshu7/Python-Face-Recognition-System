# 👤 Face Recognition System using OpenCV

Welcome to the **Face Recognition System** built with **Python** and **OpenCV**!  
This real-time application uses your webcam to detect multiple faces in a video stream and highlights each face with a rectangle — live!

---

## 🚀 Features

- 🧠 Real-time face detection
- 🔲 Draws a rectangle on each detected face
- 🔢 Displays the number of faces detected
- 🎥 Uses your system's webcam
- 💡 Powered by Haar Cascade Classifier (pre-trained)

---

## 🧰 Tech Stack

- **Language:** Python 🐍  
- **Libraries:** OpenCV (`cv2`)  
- **Classifier Used:** Haar Cascade Frontal Face

## 📝 To-Do / Future Ideas
- Add face recognition (identify "who" the person is)
- Add face mask detection
- Store face logs with timestamp
- Enhance detection with deep learning (e.g., DNN or MTCNN)
